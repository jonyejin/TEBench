# TEBench
Quantify the robustness of ML-based traffic engineering algorithms in environments where demand distributions keep changing over time.

## Definition of Robustness
- 1. [Maximum Concurrent Flow(MCF)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/77600.77620)

Maximize $Î»$ 
subject to:
0 $\leq$ $f(u, v)$ $\leq$ $c(u, v)$ for all $(u, v) \in E$,
$\sum f(u, v) = 0$ for all $v \in V \setminus {\text{sources, sinks}}$,
$\sum f(s, v) \geq \lambda$ for all $(s, v) \in E$,
$\sum f(v, t) \geq \lambda$ for all $(v, t) \in E$.

* $\lambda$: Represents the objective value to be maximized, indicating the maximum concurrent flow rate in the network.
* $f(u, v)$ : Represents the flow from node $u$ to $v$.
* $c(u, v)$: Represents the maximum allowable flow (capacity) from node $u$ to $v$.
* $E$: Represents the set of all edges in the network.
* $V$ : Represents the set of all nodes in the network.
* $\text{sources, sinks}$: Represent the sources (starting points) and sinks (destinations) in the network.


2.  Normalized Changes

$\text{Normalized Change} = \frac{\| T(t + \Delta t) - T(t) \|_2}{\| T(t) \|_2}$

* $T(t)$: Represents the traffic matrix at time $t$.
* $T(t + \Delta t)$: Represents the traffic matrix at a later time $t + \Delta t$.
* $\Delta t$: The time interval between the two observations of the traffic matrix.
* $\|\cdot\|_2$: Denotes the $L2$ norm, which measures the magnitude of a vector. In this context, it quantifies the change in the traffic matrix.


### Our Definition of Robustness 
$$
\text{Robustness} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \lambda_i (1 - \beta \cdot NC_i)
$$


  * $N$: Represents the total number of data sets or scenarios considered.
  * *$\lambda_i$: Represents the Maximum Concurrent Flow (MCF) rate for the $i$-th data set or scenario.
* $\beta$: A weighting factor that modulates the impact of the Normalized Change on the overall metric.
* $NC_i$: The Normalized Change for the $i$-th data set, indicating the change in the traffic matrix at the specific time step relative to its initial state.
* $\textbf{Robustness}$: A measure that integrates both the efficiency of flow across the network (via $\lambda_i$) and the stability of this flow over time (accounting for changes via $NC_i$).
